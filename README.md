# Markowitz Portfolio Optimization -
The Mrkowitz Theory talks about the correlation between risk and returns for different securities in a portfolio. Dominant portfolios (ones with higher return) are always preferred over dominated (one with lesser returns) ones for the same risk.
The portfolios with low risk usually result in low return and ones with higher risk associate with higher returns. Based on your value of risk, you can estimate your returns for the given portfolios. You can also calculate the weights you should give to each of the securities for an optimal portfolio.

- Plotted Efficient Frontier
- Maximised returns

#  Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) -
The CAPM model also takes into account risk free securities.It suggests that the expected rate of return is the expected return of risk free securities along with a certain risk premium.
THE Captial Market Line (CML) has the highest sharpe ratio nd hence maximises the ratio of return/risk. The Security Market Line (SML) on the other hand focuses on the relation of each securities with the market, and can indicate if it is overvalued or undervalued. It takes into account the value of beta of each security and is plotted on a graph of expected return vs beta.
